# Docker Skills Quest

## About This Project

This repository is a collection of Docker exercises designed for individuals who already have a basic understanding of Docker and wish to test their knowledge. The exercises are not intended as a comprehensive tutorial for learning Docker, but rather as a way to challenge and reinforce existing skills.

Each exercise presents a specific task to be accomplished using Docker commands, followed by a hidden solution that can be revealed for verification. The exercises are categorized to cover different aspects and features of Docker.
